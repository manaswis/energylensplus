{"name":"EnergyLens+","tagline":"Defining a novel way to personalize your energy consumption in your smart home","body":"EnergyLens+: A working prototype of a complete personal energy consumption monitoring system\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIn this research project, we introduce a new personal energy usage/wastage monitoring system for smart homes. It interacts with an eco-feedback app that runs on Android devices. It is a first of a kind system for personal energy monitoring.\r\n\r\n###About the repository:\r\nThe repository holds the code for the inference engine that analyzes the sensor data. Currently, the code is under development and hence kept private. It will soon be released. Keep watching this space for new updates to this project.\r\n\r\n### Project Members:\r\n1.
